Dungeon Decor
-------------

This is a general decoration modpack that is in use with Dungeontest.

It contains a slightly modified version of [Philipbenr's castle mod](https://github.com/Philipbenr/castles),
the chains and fake_fire mods from [VanessaE's homedecor](https://github.com/VanessaE/homedecor_modpack),
and a mod made along this modpack called "ddecor" that takes many decorative elements from the really nice mod
[xdecor from Kilbith](https://github.com/kilbith/xdecor) (you should check that one out), but adds additional
elements as deemed appropiate for dungeon decoration.

It's possible that some things don't have a crafting recipe. This might have been intentional, the purpose
of this modpack is to give decorative elements for creative-mode creators to compose adventure maps, challengue
rooms and so. It's not intended for players to craft them.

All the items are be breakable in creative mode, but many of the elements of ddecor are unbreakable if playing
in standard survival mode (ie with creative mode off).

The idea of this modpack is to provide mostly decorative items (or at least very simple ones) but should not affect
too much gameplay aspects. This is why I left out things like the enchanting table or the ender chest from xdecor.
Other mods can implement things like this their own way and add additional complexity as needed.

Note: perhaps I'll remove fake fire soon, since there will be ethernal flames in next Minetest Game version

Dependencies: nothing that isn't in vanilla Minetest
