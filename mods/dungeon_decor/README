This is a dungeon decor modpack.

It contains, from home decor:

* The actual homedecor mod, which supplies a bunch of stuff found in 
most homes (like flower pots, home electronics, brass and wrought-iron 
tables, and a bunch of other things).

* A "3d extras" mod, which supplies things that re-define something in 
some other mod (or in the default game) so that those objects become 
fully 3d (instead of a flat cube), as well as things which are directly 
related.  This mod, for example, provides 3d bookshelves and their empty 
and half-depth "open frame" counterparts.

* A signs library forked from the one that thexyz and PilzAdam first 
made, which produces visible text on signs (and which has been extended 
to put signs on fences, including the brass and wrought iron ones here 
in homedecor).

* Sdzen's building_blocks mod, which is here to supply not only a few 
blocks to build with, obviously, :-) but also to supply a number of 
materials to craft other things with.


Dependencies: none (just the game's default stuff)
