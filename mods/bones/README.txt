Minetest 0.4 mod: bones
=======================

This is a modified version of PilzAdam bones.
When right clicking a bones node while on creative an inventory will be created as a chest and as long as you are in creative you can place and remove items there.

However, if not on creative the items will only be removed, not added.

As soon as an inventory inside the bones gets empty, the interface to add/takie items will be removed.


Additionally, the node uses nodeboxes to represent bones instead of just a cube.
